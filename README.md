# Viscosity-Prediction-for-Deep-Eutectic-Solvents
This repository contains the complete workflow for viscosity prediction in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), integrating systematic data preprocessing, molecular descriptor generation (Mordredâ€“RDKit), and advanced machine learning models. The pipeline spans dataset curation, feature engineering, model training (MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Evidential Deep Learning), and evaluation with cross-validation and uncertainty quantification. It provides a reproducible framework for developing accurate and interpretable property prediction models in complex solvent systems.
